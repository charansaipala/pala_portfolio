# Run on Windows + VS Code

1. Install Node.js LTS.
2. Open this folder in VS Code.
3. Terminal:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open http://localhost:5173

## Add your picture
Place your image at:
```
public/Passport_size_1.jpg
```
The app already references `/Passport_size_1.jpg`.

If you see a blank page, make sure you're running the dev server **in this folder** (the one that contains `index.html`).
